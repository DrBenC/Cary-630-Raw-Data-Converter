# Cary-630-Raw-Data-Converter
Imports the .asp file (containing only y-data) and outputs x-y data and rough graphs for initial inspection.

Place in same directory as a .asp file generated by an Agilent ATR-IR system and run to create an x-y file with wavenumber, transmittance and absorbances. 
Also generates images of the graphs too.
